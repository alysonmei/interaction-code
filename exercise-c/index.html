	<h1>IRAN</h1>
	<p>The flag of Iran features the national emblem ("Allah") in red and the takbir written 11 times in the Kufic script in white. This flag was adopted on July 29, 1980, as a result of changes brought about by the Iranian Revolution of 1979. The revolution resulted in the replacement of 2,500 years of Persian monarchy with an Islamic Republic under the Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the revolution. It was supported by a wide range of Islamist organizations and student movements. In opposition to the current regime in Iran, a number of Iranian exiles (particularly in Los Angeles) continue to use the Iranian tricolor with the Lion and Sun at the center.</p>

	<h1>ISRAEL</h1>
	<p>The Flag of Israel, or Flag of Zion, was adopted on October 28, 1948, five months after the State of Israel was established. It depicts the Star of David, a Jewish symbol dating from late medieval Prague, between two horizontal blue lines that symbolize the design of a tallit, the traditional Jewish prayer shawl. It was designed for the Zionist movement in 1891.</p>

	<h1>MALAYSIA</h1>
	<p>The flag of Malaysia, also known as the Malay: Jalur Gemilang ("Stripes of Glory"), was first raized on September 16, 1963. It contains 14 red and white stripes that represent the equality of the 13 member states, and a blue canton bearing a crescent and 14-point star known as the Bintag Persekutuan (Federal Star). The crescent represents Islam, the country's state religion; the blue canton symbolises the unity of the Malaysian people; the yellow of the star and crescent is the royal colour of the Malay rulers.
